## The website
When you visit us online , you find following webpages:

+ Landing page
+ Shop
+ Login
+ Order history
+ Contact

### Landing page
The first thing you see when you go to our website is the mood we want to mimic when you're allowing yourself to sit back on the couch, relax and enjoy some snacks after a hard day.

From there it's very obvious how to click through to the shop and making an account or log in.
The top nav is a constant lead throughout the website to make it easy for finding things.

### Shop
When you go to the shop, you'll see a variety of snacks: healthy, hearty, sweet, salty, greasy... 

We offer a nice variety of things per theme. One pack is a portion for one person, so each person can pick a different theme and mix things up together to have a bigger assortment of snacks.

### Login
When you're at our website for the first time, and you want to order in: you have to create an account first. That's how we get to link your personal information to our system to keep things secure, but also you will have the advantage of having an 'Order history' for next time to make ordering with us even easier!

### Order history
Here you get an overview of what snacks you have ordered before and what address(es) are linked to your personal account. This overview is also a quick way to remember what you tried and what you liked to make the ordering process go even smoother.

### Contact
Whenever you have some questions about what time business is open, where we're located or questions and remarks related to our snack-packs or delivery-options, you'll find the answer here.

There's a clear map showing where to find us and how to reach us. When you press on the phone number you'll automatically call us. The contact form submits straight to our mailbox.
