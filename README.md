### Landing page
The first thing you see when you go to our website is the mood we want to mimic for allowing yourself to sit back on the couch, relax and enjoy some snacks after a hard day.

From there it's very obvious how to click through to the shop and making an account.

### Shop
When you go to the shop, you'll see a variety of snacks: healthy, hearty, sweet, salty, greasy... We offer a nice variety of things per theme. One pack is a portion for one person, so each person can pick a different theme and mix things up together to have a bigger assortment of snacks.
